This project aims to provide a Python code that allows you to generate synthetic speech from text using the pyttsx3 library. It provides customization options for voice selection, voice speed, and output file generation.

## Features

- Voice Selection: The code allows you to choose from a list of available voices supported by the pyttsx3 library. Each voice has a unique identifier, and you can specify the desired voice by selecting the corresponding number.

- Voice Speed Adjustment: You can control the speed of the synthesized speech by adjusting the rate property. A lower rate value makes the voice slower, while a higher value makes it faster.

- Text-to-Speech Conversion: The code reads the text from a specified file and generates the corresponding synthetic speech using the selected voice and speed settings. The output speech is saved as an audio file in the desired location.

## Prerequisites
